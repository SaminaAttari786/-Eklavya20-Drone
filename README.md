# Eklavya20-Drone
# DRONE SIMULATION PROJECT
A Drone or Quadcopter is a Vehicle that has a large potential for performing tasks that are dangerous and costly for humans. Examples are inspection of high structures, humanitarian purposes or search and rescue missions . Quadcopters generally have two rotors spinning clockwise (CW) and other two rotors spinning counterclockwise (CCW). Flight control is provided by independent variation of the speed and hence lift and torque of each rotor. Pitch and roll are controlled by varying the net centre of thrust by varying the net torque. Quadrotors do not usually have cyclic pitch control, in which the angle of the blades varies dynamically as they turn around the rotor hub. 
##  ABOUT THE PROJECT
   1)GOALS WE AIM TO ACHIEVE :- 
   
   We aim to achieve obstacle avoidance and flying of a drone 
   from one destination to another by simulating our drone.
   
   2)WHY THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN CHOSEN:-
   
   Quadcopter drone which is becoming increasingly popular is used to capture video for promotional 
   and surveillance purposes. The main reason to have obstacle avoidance is to prevent the drone from crashing, 
   either through pilot error or when engaged in autonomous flight. For this we have simulated a drone and 
   performed obstacle avoidance on it.
  
  
  3)TECHNOLGY USED IN THE PROJECT:-
  
   a)ROS:- ROS is Robot Operating System and it is a robotics framework which provides tools and libraries to help software developers to create robot applications . Ros consists of stacks , packages , nodes , topics , messages , services , header , bags, master, manifests and parameter server.
   
   b)GAZEBO:- Gazebo is a powerful 3D simulation environment for autonomous robots that is particularly suitable for testing object-avoidance and computer vision. 
   
   c)PYTHON:- Python is a powerful and user-friendly language used to write codes of obstacle avoidance and goal to goal.
   
   d)OpenCV:-OpenCV is a highly optimized library with focus on real-time applications. We have used OpenCV while writing code for obstacle avoidance.

## FUTURE ASPECTS AND GOALS WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE PROJECT:-
1. Our first step is to integrate obstacle avoidance and the code which we have written 
for the drone to move from one destination to another within an environment of four walls .

 2. Our second step would be to implement obstacle detection code with obstacle avoidance as 
this would be a great aid for the drone to perform then future tasks like geography mapping  ,
aerial photography without having to worry about obstacles in its way.

3. We aim to achieve our goal of obstacle detection through contour detection.
Contour detection is based on detecting the outline of the object within the environment. It is preferred because it is based upon edge detection, which has been optimized in run time and complexity, therefore, allowing for near real-time run implementations.

4. We aim to expand on our avoidance goal in the near future by implementing SLAM,so the quadrotor can create a map of the environment it is navigating. When this path is to be chosen, a stereo camera can be mounted to the quadrotor for distance estimation. Supporting this, LiDAR can also be used, and the data acquired by the system can be processed and fused for a detection algorithm.
These are our future aspects of the project.
